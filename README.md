# Text to Speech Application using Python and gTTS

## Introduction
This Python application demonstrates the usage of various libraries to create a Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter with a graphical user interface (GUI). It utilizes the following packages/libraries:
- **os:** For file operations.
- **tkinter:** For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):** For converting text to speech.
- **playsound:** For playing the generated audio.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install the required Python packages using pip:
     - **tkinter:** This library is included with most Python installations, but if you don't have it, make sure to install it as per your system's package manager or Python distribution.
  - **gTTS:** Install this library using pip:
    ```
